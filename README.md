<h1>Managing Technical Vulnerabilities</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I employ the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to initiate a vulnerability scan across an entire network, aiming to identify particular vulnerabilities. Utilizing the Greenbone Vulnerability Management framework (formerly known as OpenVAS), I conduct a comprehensive scan on a specific host to detect all potential vulnerabilities outlined in the scanner's dictionary. Subsequently, I record the associated risk entries for each identified vulnerability in SimpleRisk.<br />
